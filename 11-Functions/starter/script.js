//A function has access to the variable environment (VE) of the execution in which it was created
//Closure: VE attavhed to the function, exactly as it was at the time and place the function was created
//the booker function has access to the passengerCount because it is basically defined in the scope in which
//the booker function was actually created. So the scope chain is actually preserved through the closure, even when a scope
//has been destroyed
//This is special because the booker function is a sence has access to the parent scope. So the passengerCount
//stays with the function forever. It will be always to use it forever
//JavaScript engine has CLOSURE in higher priority than the scope chain
//for example if we had a global passengerCount variable, It would still use the one in the closeure.

//A closure is the closed-over variable environment of the execution context in which a fucntion was created
//even after that execution context is gone
//A closure gives a function access to all the variables of its parent function, even after that parent function has returned. The
//function keeps a reference to tis outer scope, shich preserves the scope chain throughout time.
//A closure makes sure that a function doesnt loose connection to variables that exister at the functions birth place
//A closure is like a backpack that a fucntion cariies around wherever it goes. This backpack has all the variables that were present in the environment
//whre the function was created

//  WE DO NOT HAVE TO MANUALLY CREATE CLOSURES, THIS IS A JS FEATURE THAT HAPPENTS AUTOMATICALLY.
//WE CAN NOT EVEN ACCESS CLOSED OVER VARIABLES EXPLICITLY. ACLOSURE IN NOT A TANGIBLE JS OBJECT.

//WE CAN TAKE A LOOK A THE INTERNAL PROPERTY.THE "BACKPACK"
