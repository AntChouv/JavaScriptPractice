      document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
        //This line of code adds an event listener to the document object in the web browser.
        //Specifically, it listens for the "DOMContentLoaded" event, which is fired when the HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed by the browser.
        //By using this event listener, you can be ensured that the JavaScript code is executed only after the HTML document has been fully loaded,
        //which can be important for preventing errors and ensuring that the page behaves as intended.

      <script src="script.js" defer></script><!--external: defer tells the browser to continue downloading the HTML content once the <script> tag element has been reached.
        To summarize, the main difference between async and defer is that async downloads and executes the script as soon as it becomes available, while defer downloads the 
        script in the background but waits to execute it until the entire page has finished parsing. It is generally recommended to use defer whenever possible to avoid 
        potential issues with script dependencies.

        Both async and defer are used to load external scripts in a non-blocking way, which means that they won't block 
        the page from loading while the script is being downloaded.

        The difference between them is that async will execute the script as soon as it's downloaded, even if the page hasn't finished loading yet, while defer will wait until 
        the page has finished loading before executing the script. 

        So, if the script doesn't rely on anything else on the page, you can use async for faster loading, but if the script 
        depends on other elements on the page, it's better to use defer to make sure everything is available when the script is executed. 

        "async" should be used when you have a bunch of background scripts to load in, and you just want to get them in place as soon as possible. 
        For example, maybe you have some game data files to load, which will be needed when the game actually begins, but for now you just want to 
        get on with showing the game intro, titles, and lobby, without them being blocked by script loading.

        SUMMARIZE: async and defer both instruct the browser to download the script(s) in a separate thread, while the rest of the page (the DOM, etc.) 
        is downloading, so the page loading is not blocked during the fetch process.
        -Scripts with an async attribute will execute as soon as the download is complete. This blocks the page and does not guarantee any specific execution order.
        -Scripts with a defer attribute will load in the order they are in and will only execute once everything has finished loading.
        -If your scripts should be run immediately and they don't have any dependencies, then use async.
        -If your scripts need to wait for parsing and depend on other scripts and/or the DOM being in place, load them using defer and put their corresponding <script> 
        elements in the order you want the browser to execute them.
