    //This line of code checks whether the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) object has completed its request and received a response from the server,
    //and whether the server has returned a successful status code (HTTP status code 200 OK) indicating that the request was successful.

    //The readyState property of the XHR object represents the current state of the request, and has the following possible values:

    /*0 (UNSENT): The XHR object has been created, but open() has not yet been called.
    1 (OPENED): open() has been called, but send() has not yet been called.
    2 (HEADERS_RECEIVED): send() has been called, and headers and status are available.
    3 (LOADING): The response data is being downloaded, and responseText contains partial data.
    4 (DONE): The entire request has completed and the response is available.
    The status property of the XHR object represents the HTTP status code returned by the server in response to the request. HTTP status codes are 
    three-digit numbers that indicate the outcome of the request, such as success, redirection, client errors, and server errors.

    Therefore, the condition xhr.readyState === xhr.DONE && xhr.status === 200 checks whether the request has completed and the status code is 200, 
    which indicates a successful response from the server. If this condition is true, it means that the response from the server is available and 
    the request was successful, so any data that was received can be processed or displayed.
